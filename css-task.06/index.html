          Popularly known as the ‘Father of the Digital World’, Steve Jobs an
          American entrepreneur, investor, co-founder of Apple Inc. Not the one
          to be satisfied with a single achievement, he moved on to make history
          in the world of consumer electronics with his foray into the music and
          cellular industry. The founder of Apple Inc, Pixar Animation Studios
          and NeXT Inc, Jobs gave information technology its life and blood. A
          master of innovation, he was known for his perfectionist attitude and
          futuristic vision. He foresaw trend in the field of information
          technology and worked hard to embrace the same in his line of
          products. With about 346 US patents by his side, Steve Jobs created a
          revolution in his field with his novel ideas and unique concepts.
          During his years at the Apple, he administered the development of the
          iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He was the mastermind behind the
          working of the company's Apple Retail Stores, iTunes Store and the App
          Store. Interestingly, with so much to fall back upon, it is quite
          amusing to know that this legendary innovator was not much educated,
          in fact a college dropout.

        <h3>Childhood and Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          Born on February 24, 1955, Steve Paul Jobs was the adopted son of Paul
          Reinhold and Clara Jobs. His biological parents were Abdulfattah
          ‘John’ Jandali and Joanne Carole Schieble, who could not raise Steve,
          as their parents objected to their relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since a young age, Jobs was exposed to the world of mechanics. He
          would spent long hours with his father, dismantling and rebuilding
          electronic devices in the family garage. It was these experiences that
          gave the little boy tenacity and mechanical prowess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academically, after passing his high school in 1972, he enrolled at
          the Reed College but dropped out of the same in a time frame of six
          months to pursue creative classes, including a course on calligraphy.
